# Activity Tracker Accuracy Improvements

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of key accuracy improvements for the RUNSTR activity tracker. These improvements address GPS drift, speed validation, and data smoothing to enhance workout tracking precision.

**Target**: Achieve production-ready activity tracking accuracy for running, walking, and cycling workouts.

## Improvement Tasks

### 1. GPS Drift Detection & Stationary Filtering ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High Impact, Easy Implementation  
**Completed Time**: 2 hours

**Problem**: When stationary, GPS drift adds false distance accumulation, leading to inaccurate workout metrics.

**Solution**: 
- Detect when speed < 0.5 m/s for 10+ consecutive seconds
- Pause distance accumulation during stationary periods
- Resume when movement detected (speed > 1.0 m/s)

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:didUpdateLocations`

**Expected Impact**: Eliminates 80% of inaccurate distance from GPS drift

**Implementation Details**: 
- ✅ Added stationary detection with 0.5 m/s speed threshold
- ✅ 10-second timer before activating stationary mode
- ✅ 1.0 m/s movement threshold to resume tracking
- ✅ Continues route visualization while pausing distance accumulation
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### 2. Speed Validation & Outlier Rejection ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High Impact, Easy Implementation  
**Completed Time**: 1 hour

**Problem**: Bad GPS points create impossible speed spikes (e.g., 50mph while running), causing major distance/pace errors.

**Solution**:
- Set realistic maximum speed thresholds by activity:
  - Running: 8 m/s (18 mph)
  - Walking: 4 m/s (9 mph)  
  - Cycling: 20 m/s (45 mph)
- Reject location updates exceeding these thresholds

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:didUpdateLocations`

**Expected Impact**: Removes major distance/pace errors from GPS glitches

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ Added activity-specific maximum speed validation
- ✅ Running: 8 m/s (18 mph) maximum speed
- ✅ Walking: 4 m/s (9 mph) maximum speed  
- ✅ Cycling: 20 m/s (45 mph) maximum speed
- ✅ Outlier locations rejected with detailed logging
- ✅ Integrated with activity type detection system

### 3. Improved Accuracy Threshold by Activity ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High Impact, Easy Implementation  
**Completed Time**: 30 minutes

**Problem**: Current 10m accuracy threshold is too loose for precision activities like running.

**Solution**:
- Implement activity-specific accuracy thresholds:
  - Running: 5m accuracy required
  - Walking: 8m accuracy required
  - Cycling: 10m accuracy required (current default)

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:maximumAccuracy` property

**Expected Impact**: Better precision tracking for different activity types

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ Dynamic accuracy thresholds based on activity type
- ✅ Running: 5m accuracy requirement (improved from 10m)
- ✅ Walking: 8m accuracy requirement  
- ✅ Cycling: 10m accuracy requirement (maintained)
- ✅ GPS readiness indicator updated to use activity-specific thresholds
- ✅ Integrated with WorkoutSession to auto-configure on workout start

### 4. Basic Kalman Filter for GPS Smoothing ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: Medium Impact, Medium Implementation  
**Completed Time**: 3 hours

**Problem**: Raw GPS coordinates are noisy, leading to inaccurate distance and pace calculations.

**Solution**:
- Implement simple 1D Kalman filter for position smoothing
- Utilize iOS `CLLocation.speed` property which includes built-in filtering
- Apply filter to distance calculations

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:didUpdateLocations`

**Expected Impact**: Significantly smoother distance/pace calculations

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ Simple 1D Kalman filter for speed smoothing with process/measurement noise parameters
- ✅ Leverages CLLocation's built-in speed measurement when available and accurate (speedAccuracy < 5.0)
- ✅ Falls back to calculated speed when CLLocation speed is unavailable or unreliable
- ✅ Weighted position smoothing for distance calculation based on GPS accuracy
- ✅ Maintains location history buffer (10 locations) for trend-based smoothing
- ✅ Dynamic smoothing: uses direct distance for high-accuracy readings (≤5.0m), applies smoothing for lower accuracy
- ✅ Comprehensive logging showing both raw and smoothed values for debugging

### 5. Moving Average for Current Pace ⏳
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium Impact, Medium Implementation  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Problem**: Instant pace calculations are very jumpy and difficult to read during workouts.

**Solution**:
- Implement 30-second rolling average for displayed pace
- Maintain buffer of recent pace values (last 30 seconds of data points)
- Update display with smoothed pace value

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:currentPace` calculation

**Expected Impact**: Much more stable and readable pace display for users

**Notes**:
- _Consider making rolling window configurable (15s, 30s, 60s options)_

---

### 7. Distance Calculation Optimization ⏳
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Lower Priority  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Problem**: Current simple Haversine distance calculation doesn't account for elevation changes.

**Solution**:
- Replace manual distance calculation with Core Location's built-in `distance(from:)` method
- This method accounts for elevation differences automatically
- Provides slightly more accurate distance on hilly routes

**Implementation Location**: `LocationService.swift:didUpdateLocations` distance calculation

**Expected Impact**: More accurate distance measurement on elevation changes

**Notes**:
- _Lowest priority but easy win for accuracy_
- _Current implementation: `let distance = location.distance(from: lastLoc)` - verify if already implemented_

## CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED (2025-08-13)

### Background Location Fix ✅
**Problem**: App stopped tracking when backgrounded with "When In Use" permission
**Solution**: Enabled background location updates for active workouts regardless of authorization level
**Files Modified**: `LocationService.swift:131-139`

### Pause Time Calculation Fix ✅  
**Problem**: Elapsed time was calculated incorrectly, reducing 5K runs by ~9 minutes
**Root Cause**: Pause time was being added to total instead of tracking pause duration
**Solution**: Properly track pause start/end times and subtract total paused time from elapsed time
**Files Modified**: `Workout.swift` - Added `pauseStartTime` and `totalPausedTime` tracking

### Info.plist Background Modes ✅
**Problem**: Missing proper background mode configuration
**Solution**: Verified and corrected UIBackgroundModes array (location + processing)
**Files Modified**: `Info.plist:20-24`

## Notes
- All improvements maintain backward compatibility with existing workout data
- Changes focus on `LocationService.swift` and related GPS processing logic
- Critical timing bugs have been resolved
- Performance impact should be minimal with proposed optimizations
