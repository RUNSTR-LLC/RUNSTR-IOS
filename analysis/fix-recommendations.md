# RUNSTR Activity Tracker Fix Recommendations

## Critical Issues Identified

### HealthKit Permission Issues
- [ ] Check if HealthKit entitlements are properly configured
- [ ] Verify Info.plist contains required usage descriptions
- [ ] Ensure permission request flow is implemented in onboarding
- [ ] Validate HKHealthStore authorization requests

### Distance Tracking Issues  
- [ ] Verify CLLocationManager is properly initialized
- [ ] Check location permission requests
- [ ] Validate distance calculation algorithms
- [ ] Ensure workout data is properly saved to HealthKit

### Configuration Issues
- [ ] Verify Xcode project capabilities include HealthKit
- [ ] Check location services are enabled in capabilities
- [ ] Validate deployment target supports required features
- [ ] Ensure code signing includes health entitlements

## Recommended Implementation Order
1. Fix HealthKit entitlements and permissions
2. Implement proper location services setup
3. Fix distance calculation and storage
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Implement user-friendly permission prompts

## Testing Strategy
1. Test on physical device (required for HealthKit)
2. Verify all permissions are properly requested
3. Test workout tracking end-to-end
4. Validate data persistence and HealthKit sync
