# Workout Tracking Accuracy Improvements

## Date: August 17, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the RUNSTR iOS app's workout tracking system to address accuracy issues, data inconsistencies, and formatting bugs.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Distance Tracking Inaccuracy**
- **Problem**: GPS-based distance calculation with aggressive filtering caused underreporting (2.89 miles vs Nike's 3.14 miles)
- **Solution**: Made HealthKit the primary source of truth for distance, with GPS used only for route visualization

### 2. **Pace Formatting Bug**
- **Problem**: Pace displayed as "10:3" instead of "10:34"
- **Solution**: Fixed formatting logic to ensure seconds are always displayed with two digits

### 3. **Extreme Value Errors**
- **Problem**: 2-minute walk recorded as 3,000 miles due to lack of validation
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive data validation with activity-specific maximum speeds

### 4. **Distance Tracking Stopping Mid-Workout**
- **Problem**: Stationary detection would completely stop distance accumulation
- **Solution**: Relaxed GPS filtering thresholds and disabled aggressive stationary mode

### 5. **Inconsistent Stats Across Views**
- **Problem**: Different views showed different values for the same workout
- **Solution**: Unified data retrieval to use consistent sources and formatting

## Technical Changes

### HealthKitService.swift
- Added real-time distance and steps queries from HealthKit
- Created `currentDistance` and `currentSteps` published properties
- Implemented `startDistanceQuery()` and `startStepsQuery()` methods
- Now queries HealthKit for authoritative workout data

### WorkoutSession (Workout.swift)
- Modified `updateWorkoutData()` to prioritize HealthKit distance over GPS
- Added comprehensive data validation methods:
  - `validateDistance()` - Prevents extreme distance values
  - `validateCalories()` - Ensures reasonable calorie counts
  - `validateSteps()` - Validates step count based on distance
- Fixed pace calculation to use HealthKit distance
- Improved pace formatting to always show two-digit seconds

### LocationService.swift
- Relaxed GPS filtering thresholds:
  - Minimum distance: 5.0m → 2.0m
  - Minimum time interval: 2.0s → 1.0s
  - Maximum accuracy: 10.0m → 20.0m
- Reduced GPS smoothing for more responsive tracking
- Disabled aggressive stationary detection that was stopping distance tracking
- Activity-specific accuracy thresholds increased for better real-world performance

### UnitPreferencesService.swift
- Centralized all unit conversion and formatting logic
- Fixed pace formatting to handle edge cases properly
- Ensured consistent formatting across the app

### WorkoutDetailView.swift
- Updated to use properly formatted pace strings
- Now uses `paceFormatted()` method instead of raw values

## Data Flow Architecture

```
HealthKit (Primary Source)
    ↓
WorkoutSession
    ├── Distance → from HealthKit
    ├── Steps → from HealthKit
    ├── Calories → from HealthKit
    └── Heart Rate → from HealthKit

GPS/LocationService (Secondary)
    ├── Route visualization only
    └── Fallback if HealthKit unavailable
```

## Validation Rules

### Distance Validation
- **Walking**: Max 3.0 m/s (~10.8 km/h)
- **Running**: Max 10.0 m/s (~36 km/h)
- **Cycling**: Max 20.0 m/s (~72 km/h)
- Minimum speed: 0.5 m/s (very slow walk)

### Calories Validation
- Maximum: 25 calories per minute
- Scales with workout duration

### Steps Validation
- Stride length range: 0.3m - 2.5m
- Validated against distance

## Expected Improvements

✅ **Accurate Distance Tracking**
- Now matches Apple Watch and other fitness apps
- Uses HealthKit as authoritative source

✅ **Correct Pace Display**
- Shows proper format (e.g., "10:34" not "10:3")
- Consistent across all views

✅ **No Extreme Values**
- 3,000 mile walks are now impossible
- All metrics validated before saving

✅ **Continuous Tracking**
- Distance tracking no longer stops randomly
- More forgiving GPS filtering

✅ **Consistent Data**
- Same values shown across all app views
- Unified data retrieval methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Side-by-side Testing**
   - Run RUNSTR alongside Nike Run Club or Strava
   - Compare distance, duration, and pace values

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Very slow walks (test minimum speed detection)
   - Sprint intervals (test maximum speed validation)
   - Long duration workouts (test data consistency)

3. **GPS Testing**
   - Test in areas with poor GPS signal
   - Test with frequent stops (traffic lights, etc.)
   - Test indoor/outdoor transitions

4. **Data Validation Testing**
   - Verify no extreme values are saved
   - Check pace formatting in all views
   - Confirm stats remain consistent

## Notes for Production

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing workout data is unaffected
- GPS is still used for route visualization
- HealthKit permissions are required for optimal accuracy
- The app now aligns with industry standards for fitness tracking
